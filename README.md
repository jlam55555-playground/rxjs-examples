# rxjs-examples
RxJS is the library for [reactive programming][1], a "programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change" (Wikipedia). Angular heavily uses RxJS's `Observable`s in order to implement reactive templates.

This will follow the [Pluralsight course "Learning RxJS Operators by Example Playbook."][2]

### Running this project
All of the source files are in `src/`. You can compile and watch any changes using `tsc -w`, or just compile once using `tsc`. The transpiled JS file will be in `js/`.
